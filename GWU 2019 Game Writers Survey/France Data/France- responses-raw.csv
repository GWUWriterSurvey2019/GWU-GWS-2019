However the recent sensibilisation of the wider public on the controversies linked to overwork in the industry, as well as a better sensibilisation of the workers on their rights and the fishy behaviours of some companies, is starting to better the situation step by step. I would however add that I think writers have one added problem to take into account : reduced professionnal mobility. Where it's easy for a programmer or a level designer to seek a job elsewhere, after growing tired of a complicated production (the famous turn over which paralyses the industry), because they are judged on relatively objective criterias, it is harder for a writer to sell its work. On one hand, because the appreciation of writing work is more subjective, and on the other because it is more difficult to claim personnal work in a game made by multiple people (when our work is not simply stolen by the project leads).",No,Yes,Unsure/Don't know enough about the options to feel comfortable making a choice,,"Thanks for this initiative. It could have been improved by approaching two important subjects : writers' experiences and studies before they ended up in the video game industry (the paths leading to it being sometimes more diverse than for other positions) and the precise nature of their work at their companies. Indeed, on that last point, I realised with my colleagues that the nature of the work required could change a lot depending on the project or the studio, as if this narrative employee expression gathered a lot of different activities and specialities, which brings up even more questions on the regularisation of their working conditions."
