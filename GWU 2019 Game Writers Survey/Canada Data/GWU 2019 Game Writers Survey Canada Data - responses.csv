For example, the job of ""Remote Writer"" is often treated as an entry level position with terrible pay. This contrasts greatly with my experience as a freelance screenwriter in the TV industry, where being a writer is NOT an entry level job and the pay reflects that. TV Script contracts are literally 10 to 20 times more than freelance game writers are usually offered. For instance, remote writers often get only a few hundred dollars per 15-30 page script. In TV, a script of equal length would net you $3,500-$7000. However, in the TV industry, execs know that it will take a few weeks to get through all the revision stages (Outline, 1st Draft, 2nd Draft, Polish), but in games they expect the whole script to be done in 2-5 days! With minor revisions. No wonder game scripts suffer in quality.

NOTE: The hourly rate I put in the question above is $45/hr, but that is only for one indie game company where I am the Narrative Director. With remote writer contacts I can end up making as little as $14/hr. 

Bottom line, I wish more people in the game industry knew that writing is a difficult skill to master and that the pay should reflect that.

My next issue is employee vs freelancer. I've been a freelancer for 20 years and I like having control of my career and rights over my creative content. Thank you Writers Guild of Canada! But in the game industry, my two options seem to be: 1) remote writer who is not paid a living wage, and 2) employee who has no creative rights and is not allowed to work on any other game projects, not even their own.  

Final Note: I know the Writers Guild of Canada (WGC) welcomes game writers in their membership, but the problem is getting the gaming companies to sign on and agree to fair script payments.
