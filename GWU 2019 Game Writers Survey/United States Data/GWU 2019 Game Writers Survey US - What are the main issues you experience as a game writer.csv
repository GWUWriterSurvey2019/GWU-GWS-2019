What are the main issues you experience as a game writer?
Lack of mobility
Living paycheck to paycheck and no guarantee for full time employment.
"Low pay, frequent instability."
"Basically, finding outlets that might actually consider publishing me. Finding work as an unknown writer as hard, and choosing not to write about major topics makes it even more difficult."
Lack of work and burnout from audience toxicity
"As a journalist, relationships with editors and publications are more valuable than negotiating a higher rate on any given piece, leaving little room to improve solvency. "
Communication
"Misunderstanding of the creative process, inconsistent titles. "
"Only recently do some studios understand what game writing or narrative design are. I think “game or level designers who ‘just happen to have great narrative sense’” are still more valued than people who self identify as writers or narrative designers, even though that makes no sense, since the former describes much of the latter’s day to day work. Just shows that these roles are stigmatized and undervalued. "
"Lack of opportunities, connections"
The perception that game writing is the same as script writing.
Jobs are hard to find and get.
Unwilliness to relocate for work
Low pay and instability. I'm paid three cents a word on a contract basis and am having difficulty finding a full time position.
"My role is not considered essential by many studios, and therefore isn't respected"
"My biggest source of anxiety is working full-time but as a contractor. You're unable to pursue other work (both for time reasons and non-compete clause), but there's a ticking clock hanging over everything. That, plus the fact that the majority of full-time game writing jobs are in California and most companies still refuse to hire remote workers, leaves me with a lot of uncertainty/dread for the future, even though everything is stable right now."
Severe lack of looking for new writers.
"I can't talk about my experience in interviews due to NDAs. Huge unpaid time commitment to complete ""tests"" for narrative design job applications. It's difficult to set up my next contract when I don't know how long my current contract will last due to pushed deadlines. Start times for projects are not convenient. This causes long gaps with no income between contracts."
"The constant threat (spoken or unspoken) that ""there are a dozen hungry kids lined up behind me willing to take five cents a word to do your job and the only difference it would make to the fans is that they'd have to pay less for a book."""
"As I mentioned earlier, my pay at my current studio started at 3 cents a word. I later found out that this was below industry standard to begin with, and my subsequent raises have amounted to fractions-of-fractions of a cent. After two years at my current studio, I am still only paid something like 3.4 cents a word. My producers are wonderful people and have argued for their writers to be paid more, but upper management has shot down their requests every time. My job feels stable because the producers like me and my work and want to keep me on, but I have technically always been a freelance contractor and could be dropped from a project at any time if they no longer found my work suitable.

The only reason I am able to continue working at my current job is because I have a mother who is willing to let me live at home and gain experience while she pays for all my living expenses, which at 26 years old is becoming a source of shame for me. If I continue at this pay rate, I will never be able to move out and be financially self-sufficient - especially not in California, where cost of living is so high. I make so little per year that I qualify for Medi-Cal welfare health insurance, and while it's a blessing to have coverage at all, I still find it embarrassing.

I feel that if I am not able to break into AAA and find a game writing or narrative design job that offers higher wages, I will eventually need to abandon my plans of working as a game writer and find a generic job. I have to be able to support myself eventually. Something's gotta give."
Low pay
"Writing and Narrative are talked about in marketing as important. But most of the team did not take it seriously, and I had to fight for it every step of the way for ten years and now I'm tired."
Crunch and being considered a nonessential part of the development process.
Low pay due to being seen as less skilled than engineers or other employees

being underpaid
"Low pay is the biggest one. I live in one of the most expensive counties in California, and I can barely afford a 1 bedroom apartment that I share with my husband, who is also employed full-time."
"In localization, I have experienced a lack of respect from company executives who view editing and translation positions as low-skill and editing and translation professionals as easily-replaceable."
Pay
Late expense reimbursements for travel
"Relatively few, thanks to the company that I'm contracted under"

Bafflingly low pay from most clients
Lack of positions 
Undervalued work
Lack of crediting
Unpaid overtime
Low pay due to exploited passion.
"There are few companies that especially value translators. Most opt to farm work out to translation agencies who divide games into small chunks done by many translators who don't interact so the project is done as quickly as possible, resulting in a large portion of Japanese games having inconsistent translations of questionable quality."
.
"The contractual rate of the tabletop game industry is dismal. My most common rate is .0325/word, with exactly one project providing anywhere near regular freelance writing rates being .10/word, obtained late last year and to be completed this year. That tends to be the highest anyone gets in the tabletop industry except for a very few, lucky bunch. This is exacerbated by the fact that the industry is still mostly seen as hobbyist writing providing supplemental income. I've had an accountant friend tell me that the wages I make are not survivable, and yet due to my family/home situation, my current freelance situation is the only suitable job at the moment. If it weren't for the fact that I live rent-free in exchange for helping out my family, I am certain that I would never be able to afford an apartment, let alone a home. In addition, many contracts I take split the already small pay in half: first on final, then on publishing. Depending on the definition of when the work is ""published,"" I might wait a span of up to six months to get a paycheck. "
Negotiating a decent salary as a freelancer.
"Crunch, too much work"
"Contract hiring created tiers of lower paid creative employees who were scrambling for a FT gig and higher paid FT technical employees who were the “real” investments. Wasn’t just me, was artists too. Also,  a past company I worked at had strategies to carefully walk the line with writing freelancers (some of whom were new writers, not vets)  to get as much control of their work as they could  specifically without giving them a leg to stand on re: employee status. Eventually the company gave moved to mostly FT contract status with the freelancers they worked with regularly, but I still don’t feel good about some of the (admittedly legal) contracts we asked young writers to sign."
Finding paid game writing work is a challenge. I'm a freelancer on the side but my only contract thus far is with a very ethical (very small) company. I have been VERY lucky. 
Basically no one wants to pay well for freelance work (with few exceptions) and there is no safety nets if any issues come up while you are working on a project or afterwards
Crunch and poorly-compensated overtime
"Lack of substantial parental leave, lack of vacation time, being expected to be in communication via email and Slack outside of work hours, being the only woman of color on the team or sometimes the entire company, systemic sexism and racism"
"Upper management giving directives to change how a game is portrayed, and having the burden of both covering up intended work and essentially creating a spin that will dictate how others view a given work"
Not being paid on time 
1) Lack of stability - six jobs since 2012. 2) No credit for work - my name was last credited in 2010. I'm not even able to join the SFWA because I can't show enough credited work!
"Inability to find a full-time, staff writing position where I can learn and grow, rather than working part-time as a freelancer"
"Instability, without question. Because I'm on the contract treadmill, I'm always looking for the next thing, and I don't feel secure enough to give up any freelance. I overwork myself, because I assume my contract won't become FTE, so the freelance provides me a cushion (it's my ""insurance policy""). But I am always effectively doing crunch hours."
"FInding stable jobs. Remote work is so easy to do but companies are still squeamish, and every entry-level job requires years of experience. Competition is ridiculous because everyone thinks they can write; HR departments use screening processes that manage the volume but miss out on great potential talent."
Finding well-paid positions and getting through the application process (both game design and narrative design work tests eat too much into time for paid work and contribute to burnout).
"A lot of jobs stay internal so new writers never get the chance to apply. It’s been difficult getting my foot in the door. Furthermore, I keep getting contracts and jobs where I don’t get paid or credited. They lay me off or decide to “part ways” or simply vanish off the face of the earth after I’ve done a full treatment and pilot. I take a lot of freelance jobs but there really isn’t a good way to get my employers so this happens a lot."
Instability in the workplace due to upper management's decisions 
Managerial roles pay a lot more than pure creative roles. I have never understood the logic in this. 
"I co-own a small studio, as well as work freelance in the localization industry.

The issues involve small, intense periods of work (where I'm either editing or writing, depending on the project) followed by long periods of waiting (assets, new ideas, sales, etc), and because of the circumstances of the other owner, I have not seen a single penny of pay in the three years I've been doing this.

My interest is in the freelance side of this coin. Localization industry is TERRIBLE in terms of pay. Since those questions were not asked, I will not provide. But if you want to look at a union, start with the freelancers in the industries who are paid by JP character/page."
Lack of portable healthcare so I could work a bunch of different jobs in a year the way tv writers do. That sounds like a great way to work and more interesting
Low pay and lack of job security (volatility of employment)
"High expectations, but being set up to fail"
difficulty finding work
"A feeling of exclusivity for new voices, especially that of marginalized groups."
"Faulty interneral structure and lack of pipeline (bottleneck at the Directorship level) leading to lack of responsibility, miscommunication, and confusion, which in turn leads to more rush, crunch, and stress."
"Low pay compared to other contractors from other disciplines in the same company. I feel that i could be getting more but have no sense of what other writers charge so im scared to overask, but when i said 50/hr he jumped at it and said yes, and the company makes a heck of a lot of money.  Im sure the programmers are being paid more, but are in no way less important for the game making money,  they're just as if not moreso interchangeable since they serve specific functions vs crafting the story that gets people to pay for things in a free to play model. "
Freelance game writers are treated as disposable. 
"Staying in the studio system, but needing to piviot to mechanics-focused Games/studios instead of narrative ones. "
Poor promotion programs
"Take a chance on new writers. Word of mouth has gotten my all of my contract gigs. I want more remote, salaried work."
Lack of relocation assistance and lack of remote jobs.
"A lack of understanding for what a game writer/narrative designer actually does. Lots of people think it's like scriptwriting for TV or film, and it's hard to explain how much goes into game writing to management."
I really enjoy my work but I'm deeply underpaid for what I do.
"Lack of remote jobs is a very serious problem for me as I have a disability (rheumatoid arthritis) and there are days when I'm able to work from bed on my laptop but would NEVER be able to get up and go to an office. And having worked remotely, successfully for 4 years, I can say there is zero reason why ""writer"" is a job that has to take place exclusively onsite, with tools like Slack, Discord, and Skype available. "
"A lot of time writing is brought to the table late and expected to magically sprinkle fairy dust over something and make it work.  Also, because technically speaking, anyone CAN write; the question is how well can they do it - there can be a lot of questioning your expertise in the way a programmer or artist may not receive it"
"Instability, lack of remote"
Being brought in too late by a team and expected to somehow come up with a brilliant narrative that doesn't change any of their existing assets or plans.
Getting studios to value writing. This has changed a lot over the years. 
"I'm personally fine with getting paid what I'm being paid right now, it's more than a living wage for where I live and I came into this job with no professional experience, but I worry that it devalues the work of others in the community. One issue with the low pay is that I would love to be able to get a spot in a coworking space to be able to get a bit more work/life separation since I work remote from home but I can't really afford that."
"Irregularity of contracts, low pay/lack of royalties"
"Job instability. I wish I could land in a nice, AAA company that's doing well and has many projects lined up. I want to work with a team that I can learn from to improve my skills. I'd like to not be dropped when they think the writing is ""over."""
"Not paid enough to live in REDACTED (big expensive city). My boss has regularly harassed me about my relationship and age, and has not been reprimanded in any way, though I've talked to HR and higher-ups."
Lack of appropriate payment and lack of diversity
lack of vertical movement
Finding a full salaried job within the field.
Cannot get a job in game writing after working on mods for 3 years
Lack of remote jobs
"Complete lack of stable, permanent positions"
"I have healthcare and benefits, but I have a chronic illness and often have to save my PTO for bad health days because 24 hours of sick day pay is not enough to cover a year of illnesses for me. This means that I take less actual vacations than my colleagues, who don't need to save their PTO for additional medical days"
"Lack of support for parents/new parents. Lack of necessarily prioritization and technical support for narrative combined with unrealistic expectations for final product, given level of support and prioritization relative to other departments. "
"Crunch, underpay, missing payments"
Lack of respect for writing as a discipline
"Low pay, hiring discrimination"
Lack of clear postings for writing positions in tabletop games.
Sites wanting me to write for free.
"no/low pay being ""compensated"" for with ""exposure"""
"Companies are not willing to pay a lot for what is, in fact, specialized work. There's a confusion between what the different jobs related to game story are, narrative design is more specialized than writing and should pay more. Some writers call themselves narrative designers when they're only writing cutscenws or editing. The different jobs and their rates need to be established; the writers guild of the UK has s good breakdown that's a good start."
Not fitting into a corporate structure and basically being unemployable
Low pay
"I've mostly had great experiences, but I was the target of a harassment campaign from internet turds in 2011."
"I'm lucky to work for a very good company that pays and treats employees well, but I am a remote contractor, so the standard issues apply: no guaranteed salary, no sick time, no vacation, and health benefits that are so crappy that they're not even worth it."
"I am in an ideal situation right now with a great studio, but I am not confident that I'd ever find another workplace that doesn't have sexism issues. I am still not entirely comfortable going to conferences, even when I am a speaker. "
"Nobody even knows my role exists. If I say I write for video games, they ask about programming. This hurts deep down inside, every time."
"Too many writers, not enough work"
Underpaid
"The main issue is everyone thinks they can write, and it's tough for clients to tell the difference between good writing and competent writing. "
"When I worked for a major game company, I was underpaid and overworked under truly terrible conditions. Now that I am freelancing, things are much better. However, I recognize that I am in the minority, in that I do most of my work for a fantastic organization that appreciates me and pays far above the industry standard."
crunch
"As a freelancer, non-compete clauses in contracts make finding ongoing work difficult for no reason."
No one is willing to pay what my rates should be
Determining path of advancement & security in gaming vs appeal of writing in Guild-protected writing fields.
 aaa
"Job stability. I’ve worked on a few games, but they were indie projects and you get let go once they get what they need from you. One place even let all the writers go and are having their players write for them instead. "
"It's difficult to get proper attribution for all the roles I fill, writer, editior, collaborator, because there's no industry standard for job titles. "
Biggest issue is being stuck on a contract status. It provides no way to move up in the company or to grow as a writer. 
Low pay
Can’t land interviews for jobs or learn about freelance opportunities 
I don't like editorial layout decisions sometimes
"Lack of opportunity for advancement, lack of representation, lack of healthcare"
Lack of understanding/appreciation from executives
Pay and job instability are the primary ones - switched fields because of it.
"It's extremely difficult to find work as a dedicated, full-time editor. I have proven again and again that I can do the work and do it well, but there just aren't enough positions available for people who do what I do. Most major game studios do not consider editing an important enough job to hire anyone to do it."
Antagonistic community
"Pay is extremely low as a journalist because there are a thousand people that can replace me for just ""exposure"". Gigs come and go and are never reliable. Freelancers need to talk among themselves to learn which publications pay and which decide to consistently ghost and not pay invoices. Staff positions in games journalism are so rare and it feels like they're given to the same 10-20 people that always have a staff job... And they often happen to be white (and mostly men) so it feels like there's no real diversity. Staff jobs also require you to move to upend your life and move to the most expensive cities in their respective countries without proper pay... And for work that is EASILY done remote. It's just not accessible for anyone that isn't privileged."
Lack of proper tools and team integration 
Fatigue
"Also an owner of an indie company, we have trouble making enough to pay much, so the work isn't reliable and I have a different day job. "
"Everyone thinks they can write, so companies who are hiring writers also expect writers and narrative designers to double as project managers, producers, artists, designers, coders, or other roles. Hiring for dedicated writing or narrative design is rare, especially in mobile."
"The main issue I have that isn't listed above is how continually misunderstood, misrepresented, and under-supported the narrative field is within the industry. We lack a formalized hierarchical structure like the one that the film & TV industries have enjoyed for years, which makes production inefficient. Our work is rarely acknowledged or celebrated, even among our peers. And the same practices used for hiring, training, and advancing in other game disciplines simply don't exist for writers."
"Think i’m in a unique position given that i work fulltime for a localization contractor, but generally that no one seems interested in actually communicating with localizing teams. Clear that we’re considered an unimportant wing of the pipeline"
Lack of remote opportunities
Pitches and job applications going unacknowledged by editors/HR departments.
Lack of residuals.
"Lack of paid work, lack of access to marketing. Same as comedy really"
"Lack of respect from many department leads, producers and stakeholders, despite working for a company that makes “narrative driven games”. Treated like an afterthought, excluded from critical development meetings, advice and input often ignored. Often “told” what to write. "
"It is hard to get paid when working freelance, or even when salaried at times. No one seems to do taxes and many places want to pay you under the table. I’ve also had edits to my work made that change meaning of my words in big ways which was then published before I could ever see said changes."
Low pay for my time and lack of remote 
"Shifting ideas, people undervaluing our contributions or saying “no one wants to read”, extreme competition for limited roles, endless crunch"
Retraining. Uptraining. Respect.
"The #1 issue is lack of remote work. It’s nuts that a writing job is more often than not expected to be onsite, when tools like Slack and Skype work just fine. Also, having issues making enough money to be able to pay for healthcare or even hold anything back for taxes. I will be SCREWED this year with the IRS after going freelance (be necessity due to lack of remote positions) and essentially taking a $20k pay cut PLUS no longer having benefits."
Finding work. Getting paid. Getting fair wage.
"I'm still new to game writing officially as an intern, though I was a QA Lead being used as a quest designer for several months unpaid on a now cancelled project. Always talks of changing my role, no action."
Trouble breaking into larger projects
"I am very lucky to be in a studio that takes really good care of me and strives to be as stable as possible. However, there's always going to be the dread of ""what if I come into the office and suddenly my job doesn't exist""; it's not likely, but I've seen it happen so many times that I know it could happen to me. Also my whole studio got upended because someone threatened us with a mass shooting. So that's terrifying. "
"I’m fortunate to work for a company that rarely crunches. However, we did have a layoff this year and fear another. That instability, and the instability that comes from having to be an at-will employee, is the main issue I experience, along with a benefits package that pales in comparison to those provided by most Game companies, and certainly those in my city. (Well, those and hideously incompetent leadership.) But I am aware of issues that affect my colleagues, such as discrimination on the basis of gender, and do my best to be an ally and used my more privileged status to fight for and stand with them."
Gender/race discrimination 
Writing tests/application process/evaluation process 
"1. Lack of available information about payment rates when figuring out how much to charge. 2. Existing unions (WGA etc.) don't really accommodate the different types of project structure that exist in the games industry (e.g. charging lower rates for indie games, with potential for royalties etc.)"
Harassment from an awful audience
"Exploitative business practices, largely focused on exceptionally low pay (below minimum wage) and unwillingness to negotiate rates.
Poor management practices that stress workers and place undue burden on them."
"I should say here: I'm a journalist, mainly a critic (but most modern journalists -- myself included -- don't have the luxury of focusing on just one aspect of writing). I have experienced all of the above at various times in my role as a member of the media -- both games media and more mainstream media (but moreso in the former)."
Finding consistent work
Lack of context from higher ups.
"Misogyny, crunch and unpaid over time in the past... none of things affect me currently "
"I currently volunteer writing for ________ but I have recently wrote a news piece for a small site called ____________. I was paid $20 for a generic news piece, which was still better than nothing. Currently, I work as a security guard for over 5 years but I want to write in the games space full time."
Fear of sudden layoffs and unemployment 
Lack of response from the publisher / IP owner
Jobs all way several years AAA experience. There are very few entry roles. I have years of writing & production experience but it’s not video game industry specific so I’m treated like I have NO experience in writing or project management. 
"i have worked a narrative designer, so my responsibilities go above and beyond writing. I am expected to create and manage a full script while also acting as art director, attending all design meetings, stakeholder meetings, client meetings, and between that get into the editor and do propping and level design support, manage audio assets, pace out dialog throughout the game, attend recording sessions, manage the narrative team, and do it across 4 games. the issue is i dont get paid enough to direct 4 games and i dont even get credited for the work i have done directing 4 games."
No remote work available
"I am a minority employee and the only one on the creative design/writing team in the ______ location for our studio. I get paid an average of $12K less than the most junior employee who is in their first year right out of school with a bachelors. I have 3 years at this company, and a Masters of Science. "
Better compensation
Lack of recognition / importance of writing / narrative to the finished product.
"Work life balance, low pay, job instability"
Crunch and instability 
"because i am a queer woman, i am often treated as less vital than other members of my team; i’m childless and unmarried, so in addition to the casual misogyny and cissexism that allow superiors to dismiss my contributions, i’m treated like i’m lazy or not committed enough if i attempt to prioritize a healthy work/life balance."
"I was a freelance game writer from October 2014 until June 2019. As a freelancer, I was denied staff employment, health benefits, and financial bonuses commensurate with those of in-house staffers performing the same functions, despite working under a master agreement for the same studio for four consecutive years across two blockbuster AAA hits. My requests to join staff as a remote resource were flatly denied, and I was not offered relocation to move. This blatant disrespect for the work that I performed is the reason why I refused to continue working as a freelancer, at which point I set about seeking a staff position as a narrative director at the local studio where I currently work."
"Bosses who hire you to do writing, but refuse to believe you know anything about it. I've been told I wanted to make the writing ""too good"" while arguing for basic grammatical coherence."
"My audience is small has very little disposable income, so they are unable to pay a fair price for my work. Major projects usually end up costing more than I make back. "
Analog rate for freelance is horribly low
"This is more of an addendum—tabletop writers and editors are paid dirt. I’m currently editing a project for ~$4/page, and the pages are NOT formatted to editing standard, so I’m making much less per word than I would editing a book. I’ve worked on projects where writers were paid $.03/word for the final deliverable, and were expected to do all the research and concept work for the gamebook, too. I made $300 for dozens and dozens of hours of work."
Prices dropping constantly
"Harassment, crunch"
"Pay is shit and I'm treated without much respect by one of California's famous RPG game developers. I'm an outsourced trash, basically."
"Overcrowded market full of writers makes it easier to do other work instead, even when writing might be more creatively fulfilling."
Lack of work
Expectation of moving for jobs.
"As a queer immigrant woman of color, I have experienced being underemployed, uncredited, unfairly compensated, and denied advancement in my roles as both editor and game writer."
Lack of job security + lack of benefits = overwork and stress
"The ongoing struggle for narrative in games to be recognized and incorporated as a discipline the equal of art, engineering, or design in the commercial and artistic success of a product."
"Restructuring, waiting upwards of a week for email response from editor "
