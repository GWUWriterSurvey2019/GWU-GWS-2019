# GWU-GWS-2019
This repo hosts data and reports from Game Workers Unite 2019 Game Writers Survey!

# What's in this repo?

[Game Workers Unite](https://www.gameworkersunite.org/) conducted a survey of game writers and adjacent roles in 2019. The survey collected responses from the US, France, Germany, and Canada. All surveys collected data about issues at work, salary, and opinions on unionization. All surveys asked about the income of writers in 2018 and the expected (or actual) income made in 2019.

## What does the survey ultimately tell us? 

The best way to generate an opinion on the data is to open up these files and start taking a look yourself! Some of the data reinforces things we already know, like there are a lot of game developers in California. Other data gives us more nuanced understanding on how different factors are affecting the careers of game writers, like - on the whole- game writers that self-identify as marginalized have less experience (stay in games for a shorter time) and make less throughout their career than their non-marginalized colleagues. 

## US Survey

The US Survey received the highest amount of responses and support during the response collection period, so it will have the most in it to look at. Conducted by GWU DC.

# Misc. Info

## The survey was in 2019. This is being released in 2022. What took so long?

TLDR: The covid-19 pandemic.

Longer story: Keep in mind all work by GWU is done by game workers volunteering their free time! The survey committee was done collecting entries around March 2020, and moved on to creating a report with a data scientist, visualizer, and figuring out the specifics of what and how to release a report - something GWU had never done before. GWU was undergoing an internal restructuring at the time when the Covid pandemic hit. These combined forces stopped a lot of organizing, and the committee conducting the survey fell silent. Around 2021, a very small amount of organizing was returning, and of those of the committee still left, we agreed we should do something to expedite the release of the info. We won a small grant from CoWorker - called the Solidarity Fund - and used the money to pay a data scientist and visualizer to produce a high quality report with us. Unfortunately, they had to discontinue working on the project half-way through, leaving us with not much to work with by the end of 2021. So, now, in 2022, we're going forward with a very basic barebones release of the data!

## Can I use this data for my own research?

Yes. This is an open source release, and we want you to build on what you find useful. It uses a creative commons license - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

## Can I use this data to help organize my union?

Yes. Use this however you want to build worker power!

## How come there are more US responses than other regions in the world?

At the time, GWU had its largest membership in the US, and therefore the survey had the most resources and support in the US. Regions outside of the US also tend to have much smaller communities for game writers. For instance, GWU Germany estimated their responses was likely representing over 75% of the game writer community in their region.

## What are the deleted responses from in the US data?

A small group of internet trolls entered false entries one day to mess with the survey. They were deleted.

## What are some other game industry salary sources I can look at?

## I want to form a union! How do I do that?

There are lots of groups helping build unions for tech and game employees, freelancers, and building more co-ops too. Here are some.
